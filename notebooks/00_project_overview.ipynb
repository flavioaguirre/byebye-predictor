    "The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a customer will churn based on various characteristics related to their behavior and opinions expressed on forums or social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Kaggle's renowned \"Telco Customer Churn\" dataset to train our model, as it has the initial labels necessary for a reasonably good baseline model. We will then simulate a more realistic environment by acquiring data from public comments about phone services on social media platforms like Reddit. This approach allows us to incorporate sentiment analysis and natural language-derived features as part of our predictive model."
